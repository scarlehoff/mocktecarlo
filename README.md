# mocktecarlo
Academic project.

Uses:
   - Cuba Library (4.2)
   - LHAPDF (6.1.6)
   - Fastjet (3.2.1)

Compile:
scons .

Note:
This code already served its purpose as a crosscheck for ""some other"" code. 
I will make it into a "write your own Monte Carlo for HEP" tutorial when/if I have the time. 

Any questions, feel free to contact me!
